# 💬 LangGraph-Powered Python Code Assistant

### 🚀 Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered Python coding assistant** that uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate logic flow between user interaction, intent classification, RAG-based retrieval, and LLM completion.  
It can **understand user intent**, **retrieve relevant examples**, and **generate or explain code** intelligently — all organized as a **state machine** for clean, modular design.

## 🧩 Project Structure

### **Task 0: LangGraph-Powered Code Assistant**
Build a smart assistant that:
- Accepts natural language input from the user.
- Infers intent: whether the user wants to **generate** or **explain** Python code.
- Retrieves similar code examples using **semantic search**.
- Uses an **LLM API** to produce the final explanation or code output.

---

### **Task 1: System Deployment**
Integrate and deploy the entire system (Tasks from Weeks 3, 4, and 5) into a single, functional application.  
Deployment can be done using one of the following frameworks:

- 🌐 **FastAPI**
- ⚙️ **Django**
- 🔥 **Flask**
- 🖥️ **Streamlit** (used in this project)

---

### **Task 2: Presentation**
A concise PowerPoint presentation (maximum **12 slides**) summarizes:
- Project **objectives**
- **Methods** and architecture
- **Results** and insights
